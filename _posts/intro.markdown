I'm a third-year Ph.D student in the State Key Lab of CAD & CG at Zhejiang University in China. My advisors are Prof. Deng Cai and Prof. Xiaofei He. Now I'm a intern at DAMO Academy, Alibaba China.

My research interests fall in the general areas and applications of machine learning and Computer Vision, especially the recent developments in Causal Inference, Graph Neural Network and reinforcement learning to work towards the goal of the combination of Representation Learning.
